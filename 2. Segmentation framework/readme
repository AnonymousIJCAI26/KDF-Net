Models and Training Framework：

This directory contains all neural network architectures and the complete training/evaluation framework for the proposed KDF-Net.

Directory Structure：

1. models:
    "backbone" - Foundational feature extraction architectures
    "kdfnet" - Implementation of the proposed "KDF-Net" (Knowledge-aware Dynamic Fusion Network)
    "baselines" - Comparison methods and baseline models

2.  Main Implementation Scripts:
  
  I. Configuration & Data Handling:
     "config_setting_mama_mia.py" - Configuration settings for the MAMA-MIA dataset
     "mama_mia_dataset.py" - Dataset class for MAMA-MIA data
     "mama_mia_loader.py" - Data loading utilities

  II. Training & Evaluation:
    "cross_validation.py" - Main training script (5-fold cross-validation)
    "test_cross_validation.py" - Testing script for cross-validation results
    "engine.py" - Core training/evaluation engine with training loops

  III. Utilities:
    "utils.py" - Helper functions (metrics, logging, visualization)

3. Training:
    To train the model using 5-fold cross-validation:
        python cross_validation.py 

4. Testing:
    To evaluate the trained model:
        python test_cross_validation.py
