## Project Overview

KDF-Net introduces a novel paradigm shift from learning kinetics from data to seeing kinetics through knowledge in breast Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) analysis. Unlike conventional deep learning approaches that discard temporal context or reduce it to uninterpretable feature stacks, KDF-Net architecturally elevates pharmacokinetic principles to the status of first-class inputs, providing intrinsically interpretable predictions aligned with clinical reasoning.
